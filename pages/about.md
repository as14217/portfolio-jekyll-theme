# Anuja's Portfolio

Hi! I'm Anuja. I'm based in London, graduated in 2021 with a Master's in Engineering and am now a first-year PhD student in the Chemistry department at UCL. My current project is on the development of ultrasensitive biosensors for early Alzheimer's diagnosis. I hope to work for a diagnositcs start-up once I have completed my doctoral research. I love travelling, surfing, and yoga.
